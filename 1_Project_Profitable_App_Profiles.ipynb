    "The primary aim of this project is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of mobile applications, seeking to identify app profiles that exhibit profitability within the App Store and Google Play markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "This objective is pursued through the examination of two distinct datasets. One dataset pertains to the Google Play Store Apps, encompassing information on roughly ten thousand Android applications available on Google Play. The other dataset, Mobile App Store, encompasses data on approximately seven thousand iOS applications featured in the App Store.\n",

For eg, a musical family game will belong to Music, Game, Family genres. This means the genre column is a detailed representation of the category column. For our purpose, looking at the category column is sufficient, because we want to see the distribution within the app store.\n",

In contrast to the apple store, the most common free english apps in the android store are related to the `Category` `Family`, `Games` are on the second place. Like the apple store, Although the `Games` `Category` is not that strongly represented in like in the app store, it is still a very common `Category` in the android store. However, if we investigate this further, we can see that the `Family` `Category` means mostly games for kids.\n",

However, it is evident that `practical purpose` apps are more prominently represented on Google Play in comparison to the App Store. This observation is further corroborated by the frequency table we have for the 'Genres' column."
