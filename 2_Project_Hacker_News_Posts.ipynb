    "This analysis entails a comparative analysis of two distinct categories of posts on Hacker News. Therefore we will explore the Hacker News [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hacker-news/hacker-news-posts). Regarding the information on kaggle, this dataset contains Hacker News posts for 12 month, up to September 26 2016. The Data is coming from the Hacker News [website](https://news.ycombinator.com). \n",
    "\n",
    "##### What is Hacker News?\n",
    "Hacker News is a prominent platform where technology-related stories, referred to as 'posts,' undergo voting and commentary. The two categories under examination are delineated by posts commencing with either `'Show HN'` or `'Ask HN'`. `'Show HN'` posts are submissions aimed at showcasing projects, products, or intriguing content to the Hacker News community. Conversely, `'Ask HN'` posts are submissions directed at the Hacker News community to pose specific inquiries, such as soliciting recommendations for exemplary online courses.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### What is the project about?\n",
    "Our specific focus involves a comparative investigation between these two post types, aiming to discern:\n",
    "- Do Ask HN or Show HN receive more comments on average?\n",
    "- Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?\n",
    "\n",
    "It is to note that the dataset utilized underwent a reduction process, wherein nearly 300,000 rows were initially narrowed down to approximately 20,000 rows. This reduction involved the elimination of submissions lacking any comments, followed by a random sampling of the remaining submissions.\n",
    "##### The dataset\n",
    "The dataset includes the following columns:\n",
    "- **ID**: The ID of the user\n",
    "- **title**: title of the post\n",
    "- **url**: the url of the item being linked to\n",
    "- **num_points**: the number of upvotes the post received\n",
    "- **num_comments**: the number of comments the post received\n",
    "- **author**: the name of the account that made the post\n",
    "- **created_at**: the date and time the post was made (the time zone is Eastern Time in the US)\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets start.\n",

Simultaneously, the apex average comment count within the `'Other Posts'` section is observed at 9 a.m., totaling approximately 32 comments. The `'Other Posts'` section exhibits the highest average values for comments and points. This trend could be attributed to its broader scope, fostering more extensive discussions on diverse topics. Conversely, the `'Ask Posts'` primarily revolve around question-related topics, while the `'Show Posts'` predominantly feature user-generated projects and related discussions."

    "In this project, we conducted an analysis encompassing the `'Ask Posts'`, `'Show Posts'`, and `'Other Posts'` sections extracted from the Hacker News website. The objective was to identify the post types and corresponding time frames that tend to accumulate the highest average comments and points. Based on our comprehensive analysis, with a specific focus on the `'Ask Posts'` and `'Show Posts'` sections, our recommendation is to create a post in the `'Ask Post'` section, between 10:00 and 11:00 (Central European Standard Time), to achieve the highest average comment count. For optimizing average points, our suggestion is to create a post in the `'Show Post'` and creating it between 18:00 and 19:00 (Central European Standard Time).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is crucial to acknowledge that our analysis was conducted on a dataset that excluded posts lacking any comments. Consequently, a more accurate statement would be that among the posts that received comments, the average comment count was higher for `'Ask Posts'` and the average point count was higher for `'Show Posts'` (excluding the `'Other Posts'` section)."
