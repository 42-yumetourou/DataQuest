#### Project Introduction
One of the most controversial issues in the U.S. educational system is the efficacy of standardized tests and whether they're unfair to certain groups. Given our prior knowledge of this topic, investigating the correlations between SAT scores and demographics might be an interesting angle to take. New York City boasts a substantial immigrant population and exhibits remarkable diversity. Therefore, evaluating demographic variables such as race, income, and gender in conjunction with SAT scores serves as a valuable method to assess the equity of the SAT. Specifically, if particular racial groups consistently demonstrate higher performance on the SAT, it could potentially indicate inequities within the test.
