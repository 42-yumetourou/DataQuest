#### Project Introduction
The primary objective of this project is to construct a spam filter capable of classifying new messages with an accuracy exceeding 80%. Using a dataset including 5,572 messages, labeled as spam or ham (non-spam) by humans, the project includes data science topics such as exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
