#### Project Introduction
In this project, we aim to cleanse and subsequently analyze exit surveys obtained from employees associated with the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) and the Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE)) body of the Queensland government in Australia. The primary focus of this project lies in the cleansing of the datasets, demonstrating proficiency in the skills within this domain. Subsequent to the data cleansing process, the analytical phase will ensue.
