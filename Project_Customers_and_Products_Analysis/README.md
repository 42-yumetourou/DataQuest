#### Project Introduction
Data analysis emerges as very good in enhancing sales effectiveness by extracting key performance indicators (KPIs) that inform strategic decision-making, resulting in significant time, resource, and cost savings.

Sales data analysis encompasses various dimensions, spanning sales, production, customer experience, and employee efficiency, thereby presenting diverse challenges. Such a project serves as a compelling demonstration of analytical skills. The objective of this project is to inspect data sourced from a database housing sales records for scale model cars, extracting actionable insights for decision support.

Effective analysis begins with well-defined questions. The following queries guide the investigation:

Which products should we order more of or less of?
How should we tailor marketing and communication strategies to customer behaviors?
How much can we spend on acquiring new customers?
