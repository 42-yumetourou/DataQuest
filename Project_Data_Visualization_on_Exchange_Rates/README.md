#### Project Introduction
In this analysis, we will use a dataset focused on exchange rates, with the primary objective of demonstrating skills in the domain of explanatory data visualization using Python. While doing this, we are going to look into the "The Great Recession", which originated in the USA and subsequently spread throughout the world. Spanning from 2007 to 2009 in the USA, this economic downturn persisted for an extended duration in other economies worldwide. The root cause was excessive mortgage lending to borrowers who normally would not qualify for a home loan, which greatly increased risk to the lender.
