#### Project Introduction
In this project we will analyze a dataset comprising used cars sourced from eBay Kleinanzeigen, which is a classifieds segment on the German eBay website. On this platform, individuals buy, sell and trade a range of goods, including used cars. This section is specifically aimed at local communities and offers a diverse selection of used vehicles, from budget options to high-end models. Users can navigate an extensive selection, engage directly with sellers to negotiate offers, explore vehicle histories, and obtain important details to make informed purchasing decisions.

The dataset was initially gathered through web scraping and subsequently made available on Kaggle. The current dataset utilized in this analysis consists of 50,000 data points, curated by Dataquest. This version was prepared to simulate a less-refined representation of the data. The principal objective of this project revolves around data cleansing and the analyzation of the included used car listings.
