#### Project Introduction
This analysis entails a comparative analysis of two distinct categories of posts on Hacker News. Therefore we will explore the Hacker News dataset. Regarding the information on kaggle, this dataset contains Hacker News posts for 12 month, up to September 26 2016. The Data is coming from the Hacker News website.

Our specific focus involves a comparative investigation between these two post types, aiming to discern:

- Do Ask HN or Show HN receive more comments on average?
- Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?

It is to note that the dataset utilized underwent a reduction process, wherein nearly 300,000 rows were initially narrowed down to approximately 20,000 rows. This reduction involved the elimination of submissions lacking any comments, followed by a random sampling of the remaining submissions.
