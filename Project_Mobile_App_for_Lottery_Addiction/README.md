#### Project Introduction
A significant portion of individuals initially engage in lottery participation for fun purposes, yet for a subset of this people, this amusement activity transitions into a habitual behavior, eventually leading to addiction. Similar to other compulsive gamblers, those addicted to the lottery often use their savings or create debts, which could result in desperate actions like theft.

A medical institution dedicated to addressing and mitigating gambling addictions has tasked us with developing the core logic for a mobile application aimed at assisting lottery addicts in better assessing their chances of winning. While the institution's engineering team will handle the app's technical implementation, they require us to design the foundational algorithms and calculate relevant probabilities.

In the initial iteration of the app, the focus will be on the 6/49 lottery. We are tasked with creating functions that allow users to answer key questions, such as:

- What is the likelihood of winning the jackpot with a single ticket?
- What is the likelihood of winning the jackpot when playing multiple tickets (e.g., 40 tickets)?
- What is the likelihood of matching at least five, four, three, or two winning numbers on a single ticket?
