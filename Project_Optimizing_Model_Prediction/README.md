#### Project Introduction
In this project, we aim to optimize the prediction of forest fire damage using the Forest Fires dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset contains information on forest fires in the Montesinho Park, Portugal, along with meteorological and environmental variables that potentially influence fire size. The objective is to predict the burned area (area) of the forest, which is highly skewed toward small values and has a long tail of larger fires. To address this, we log-transform the target variable to reduce skewness and improve model performance.
