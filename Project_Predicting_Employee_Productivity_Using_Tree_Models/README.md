#### Project Introduction
Our goal in this project is to build predictive models using tree-based algorithms, such as Decision Trees and Random Forests, to forecast employee productivity. The dataset's versatility allows us to approach this problem from both regression and classification perspectives:

- Regression: Predicting the actual productivity as a continuous value ranging from 0 to 1.
- Classification: Transforming the productivity range into discrete classes and predicting the class labels.
