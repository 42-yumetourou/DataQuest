#### Project Introduction
In this project, we utilize linear regression to predict insurance costs. Linear regression is a fundamental statistical model that establishes a linear relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The objective of this project is to develop a model that accurately predicts insurance costs based on demographic characteristics and other relevant factors.
