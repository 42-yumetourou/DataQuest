#### Project Introduction
In this project, we will work as a data scientist for an investment firm interested in the Indian market's Initial Public Offerings (IPOs). The firm aims to predict whether an IPO will yield listing gains, which is the percentage increase in the share price of a company from its IPO issue price on the day of listing. Successful prediction of IPO listing gains can provide valuable insights for strategic investment decisions, enabling the firm to identify high-potential IPOs and optimize its investment portfolio.
