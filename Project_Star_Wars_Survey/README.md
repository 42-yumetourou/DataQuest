#### Project Introduction
The main focus of this project is the comprehensive cleaning and analysis of a survey dataset related to the Star Wars series. The data set includes various information, including respondents' opinions, preferences, and answers to specific questions about various aspects of the Star Wars films. Given the nature of survey data, which often includes multiple-choice questions and varying response formats, a careful cleaning process is essential to ensure the consistency and reliability of the data set.

The analysis phase examines patterns within the data set and provides insights into audience feelings and preferences regarding the Star Wars films. By using data science techniques, this project aims to derive meaningful conclusions from the survey data and shed light on respondents' diverse perspectives and engagement with the iconic Star Wars franchise.
