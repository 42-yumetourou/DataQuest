#### Project Introduction
For this exercise, we step into the role of somebody who likes to go to the gym. However, this person hates getting to the gym and finding that it is so crowded that this person must wait to use the machines. Luckily, we have all the skills and knowledge to build a model that will help us predict the best time to go to the gym and avoid crowds, so this person can enjoy a great workout with minimal wait times and no crowds. Our task is to use the "Crowdedness at the Campus Gym‚Äù dataset, which contains historic information about how crowded the campus gym is on a given day and hour, as well as other specific information about the specific days.

We'll use the Pandas library to load the dataset into a DataFrame, run exploratory data analysis, and clean the dataset for training a model. After cleaning the set, we'll split the data into training and testing sets. Then, we'll use the SDGRegressor from the Scikit Learn library to build and train a stochastic gradient descent linear regression model to predict how many people are at the gym on a given day from the features inputed. Finally, we'll evaluate the model and visualize the results using matplotlib.
