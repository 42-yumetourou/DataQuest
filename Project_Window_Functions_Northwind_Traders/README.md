#### Project Introduction
This project focuses on the rich Northwind database, which provides a real-world-like platform for exploring and analyzing sales data.

This project aims to extract complex insights from the data using SQL window functions and CTEs. We'll use advanced SQL techniques to calculate running totals, compute averages, rank items, and analyze growth rates. These techniques are fundamental for advanced data analysis and will help to answer complex business questions.
