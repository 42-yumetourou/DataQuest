    "`Jeopardy!` is a long-running American television game show created by Merv Griffin. It first premiered in 1964 and has since become one of the most iconic and enduring game shows in television history. The show features a unique format where contestants are presented with general knowledge clues in the form of answers, and they must phrase their responses in the form of questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The game is divided into three rounds: the Jeopardy round, the Double Jeopardy round, and Final Jeopardy. In each round, contestants select clues from a game board that is divided into categories and point values. Contestants can accumulate points by providing correct responses, and they can also wager points in the Final Jeopardy round based on their confidence in the category.\n",
    "\n",
    "The show's format, challenging questions, and iconic theme music have made it a cultural phenomenon, with fans spanning generations. It has won numerous awards and accolades throughout its history and remains a beloved staple of American television.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine that you want to compete on Jeopardy, and you're looking for any way to win. In this project, we'll work with a dataset of `Jeopardy!` questions to figure out some patterns in the questions that could help you win.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains 20000 rows from the beginning of a full dataset of Jeopardy questions, which you can download [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/1uyd0t/200000_jeopardy_questions_in_a_json_file/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The data contains the following columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Show Number` - the Jeopardy episode number\n",
    "- `Air Date` - the date the episode aired\n",
    "- `Round` - the round of Jeopardy\n",
    "- `Category` - the category of the question\n",
    "- `Value` - the number of dollars the correct answer is worth\n",
    "- `Question` - the text of the question\n",
    "- `Answer` - the text of the answer\n",
